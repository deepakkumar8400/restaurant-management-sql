# SQL Project â€“ Comprehensive Database Management and Queries

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design, creation, and querying of a relational database using SQL.  
It covers **basic to advanced concepts**, including table creation, relationships, constraints, indexing, aggregation, and complex joins.  
The aim was to create a realistic dataset and use SQL queries to solve business-related problems.

## Features
- Multiple related tables (e.g., Users, Products, Orders, Payments)
- Primary and foreign key constraints
- One-to-many and many-to-many relationships
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
- Complex joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`)
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Views for simplified data retrieval
- Index creation for performance improvement

## Tech Stack
- **Database**: MySQL (can be adapted to PostgreSQL or SQL Server)
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin
